difference between linkedlist class and arraydeque class :-

Both `LinkedList` and `ArrayDeque` are implementations of the `Deque` interface in Java, which represents a double-ended queue. However, they have different underlying data structures and performance characteristics.


1. Data Structure:
   - `LinkedList`: It is implemented as a doubly-linked list. Each element in the list contains a reference to the previous and next elements, allowing efficient insertion and deletion at both ends of the list.
   - `ArrayDeque`: It is implemented as a resizable array. The elements are stored in a circular buffer, allowing efficient insertion and deletion at both ends of the queue.


2. Random Access:
   - `LinkedList`: It does not provide efficient random access to elements. Accessing an element by index requires traversing the list from the beginning or end, which takes O(n) time.
   - `ArrayDeque`: It provides efficient random access to elements. Accessing an element by index takes constant O(1) time.


3. Insertion and Deletion:
   - `LinkedList`: It provides efficient insertion and deletion operations at both ends of the list. Inserting or removing an element at the beginning or end of the list takes constant O(1) time.
   - `ArrayDeque`: It also provides efficient insertion and deletion at both ends of the queue. However, when the array needs to be resized due to capacity constraints, the operation takes O(n) time.


4. Memory Overhead:
   - `LinkedList`: Each element in the list requires additional memory to store references to the previous and next elements, resulting in higher memory overhead compared to `ArrayDeque`.
   - `ArrayDeque`: It has lower memory overhead since it stores elements in a continuous resizable array.


5. Usage Patterns:
   - `LinkedList`: It is suitable when there is a need for frequent insertion or deletion operations at both ends of the list, but random access is not a requirement.
   - `ArrayDeque`: It is suitable when there is a need for efficient random access as well as frequent insertion and deletion operations at both ends of the queue. It provides a good balance between the two operations.



In summary, `LinkedList` is typically used when efficient insertion and deletion at both ends of the list are the primary concern, while `ArrayDeque` is preferred when efficient random access is also required along with insertion and deletion operations.
